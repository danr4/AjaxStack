#Useful JavaScript libraries and scripts to help develop Ajax / SPA Apps

The libraries included here intend to be small, self-contained, useful libs with either 0 dependencies or at most will depend only on:

  * [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (3KB packed and Gzipped) and
  * [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (3.9KB packed and Gzipped) .

Their small footprint should make it an easy drop-in for any javascript-enabled page that needs it.

This aims to be a high quality collection of JavaScript or [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) scripts striving to be developed with the same elegance and ethos as [@jashkenas](http://twitter.com/jashkenas) excellent work.

We hope to invite other contributors who love JavaScript and writing Ajax applications. 
Feel free to extend, enhance or provide any other positive contribution you like to see here.
