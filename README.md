#Useful JavaScript libraries and scripts to help develop Ajax / SPA Apps

The libraries included here intend to be small, self-contained, useful libs with either 0 dependencies or at most will depend only on:

  * [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (3KB packed and Gzipped) and
  * [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (3.9KB packed and Gzipped) .

Their small footprint should make it an easy drop-in for any javascript-enabled page that needs it.

This aims to be a high quality collection of JavaScript or [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) scripts striving to be developed with the same elegance and ethos as [@jashkenas](http://twitter.com/jashkenas) excellent work.

## Downloads


While this project is starting up, we've bundled an elegant starting point useful we think would be useful for the JS Ninja :)


  * [jqunback-1.51.js](https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/raw/master/lib/jqunback-1.51.js) 
    and [jqunback-1.51.min.js](https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/raw/master/lib/jqunback-1.51.min.js) - jQuery.1.51, Underscore.js and Backbone.js in a single file.
  
  * [zepunback-0.5.js](https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/raw/master/lib/zepunback-0.5.js) 
    and [zepunback-0.5.min.js](https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/raw/master/lib/zepunback-0.5.min.js) - 
  	Same as above but using the much lighter Zepto.js 0.5 instead optimized for webkit on mobile devices.
  
  * [jsonreports.js](https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/raw/master/src/jsonreport/jsonreport.js) - Pretty Print JSON viewer in JavaScript


### Help get Backbone.js get on a CDN

Backbone.js is an awesome library embodying the beauty and elegance of JavaScript. We think having the merged starting bundles available on a CDN will help give it more reach and wider appeal and better able to have it included in online js tools like: http://jsbin.com and http://jsfiddle.com etc.

If you want this as well **[Vote for it on cdnjs.com feedback site](http://goo.gl/tJC7v)**

## Seen in the wild

  * [JsonReport GitHub project](https://github.com/gokulives/JsonReport) that Pretty Prints JSON inside Chrome with a Chrome extension - Very useful!
